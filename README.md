# Love Running Website

## Purpose

This website is based on the Love Running Walkthrough Project provided by Code Institute. The goal was to practice using HTML and CSS to build a basic website. 

The purpose of the Love Running website is to:
* generate interest in the club and share the club's goals. 
* share a map showing running meeting points.
* share photos of recent club events.
* share the club's running timetables and locations. 
* provide various contact options for interested runners.
* provide links to the club's social media pages. 

The website is targeted at runners who would like to join a running club. 

## User Stories
